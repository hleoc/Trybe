    <h1>Nothing Else Matters</h1>
    <p>So close no matter how far<br>
Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
Forever trusting who we are<br>
And nothing else matters</p>
    <p>Never opened myself this way<br>
Life is ours, we live it our way<br>
All these words I don't just say<br>
And nothing else matters</p>
    <p>Trust I seek and I find in you<br>
Every day for us something new<br>
Open mind for a different view<br>
And nothing else matters</p>
<p>Never cared for what they do<br>
Never cared for what they know<br>
But I know</p>
